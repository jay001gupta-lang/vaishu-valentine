<h1>A Tale That Began Beneath the Evening Sky ✨</h1>
<h2>As you choosen Perhaps, Let me recite a poem for you...</h2>

<div class="poem-container">
<p class="poem-text">

We met beneath a quiet sky,
In a garden wrapped in midnight’s sigh.
Two strangers standing worlds apart,
Unaware we’d soon share one heart.

A mutual friend, a casual start,
Random talks of films and art —
Bollywood dreams and anime scenes,
Laughter slipped through in-betweens.

That night when I returned alone,
Your Instagram quietly shone.
A classical dancer — grace divine,
As though the stars had learned to align.

I praised you softly, light and true,
Yet you smiled it off, as though you never knew.
Perhaps you didn’t see just then,
My heart had chosen you even then.

Then came the day of ramen plans,
A mall, our friends, our separate stands.
You paused aside in parking light,
Speaking softly, glowing bright.

In that small moment, unaware,
My guarded heart surrendered there.

Inside the mall our laughter grew,
Conversations dancing, fresh and new.
When selfies started, I stood apart,
Trying to quiet a racing heart.

But you came close and gently said,
“Come, let’s take one instead.”
That single frame, that captured glance,
Felt like fate had given a chance.

Butterflies rose without control,
A silent storm within my soul.
You were admired, bright, adored —
So I stayed quiet, unsure and floored.

That night outside in playful cheer,
We laughed like children without fear.
And slowly, softly, days went by,
Friendship deepened quietly.

Then came a bracelet, small yet true —
An infinity sign, my promise to you.
“Always and forever,” I dared to say,
And your smile lit up my day.

Then one warm evening, kitchen light,
White pasta cooking, hearts alight.
You wrapped your arms around me tight —
And in that hug, the world felt right.

And when I planned to speak my heart,
Destiny chose to play its part —
Before the words I meant to say,
Our first kiss gently led the way.

And from that day until today,
This love has only grown its way.
Not fleeting, fragile, passing through —
But steady, certain… me and you.
